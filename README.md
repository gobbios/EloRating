# EloRating2

currently on CRAN:

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/EloRating)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=EloRating)


This is my first attempt to put the `EloRating` package on GitHub.

Until the transfer of all functions to GiHub is complete, the package is named `EloRating2` and should be considered incomplete.

To install the current version, use the following command:

`devtools::install_github("gobbios/EloRating2")`
