Since version 0.45-0, the package contains C++ code, which means that you need to have some extra tools installed on your system if you want to install the package directly from GitHub:

+ **Windows**: Rtools from  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/

+ **Mac**: Xcode from the App Store


If you want to have a pdf of the tutorial, please use:
